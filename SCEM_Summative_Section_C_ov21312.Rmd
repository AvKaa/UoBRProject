#Synopsis

As the publisher of this dataset suggests; due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).
This specific dataset can be viewed as classification or a regression task. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).
As the publisher suggest, we will classify the wines by setting an arbitrary cutoff for our dependent variable (wine quality) at e.g. 7 or higher getting classified as 'good/1' and the remainder as 'not good/0'. For this specific kernel we will be doing some basic data explorations and will be doing classification utilizing a quick random forest as our baseline model. 

#Let's have a peek of our dataset

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Libraries needed
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("corrplot")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("randomForest")
```

```{r}
# library(ggplot2, ggthemes, corrplot, reshape2, dplyr, randomForest)
library(tidyverse)
library(corrplot)
library(randomForest)
<<<<<<< HEAD
```

```{r}
#Load in our dataset
redwine<-read.csv("./winequality-red.csv")

#Create a variable indicating if a wine is good or bad
redwine$quality_wine<-ifelse(redwine$quality>6,1,0)

#Let's look at some summary statistics
str(redwine)
summary(redwine)
```

As we can see, we will be working with an unbalanced dataset, wherein only around 13.57% out of 1599 wines is considered as a good wine.

#Exploratory Data Analysis

In this section we will be doing some exploratory data analysis to have a better understanding of the data we are working with

##Correlation of Variables

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
#Scatterplot Matrix of Variables
plot(redwine)

#Correlation Heatmap of Variables
corrplot(cor(redwine))
```

We're trying to predict wine quality, so we care about the final 2 columns/rows in order to know which among the variables has the strongest relationship with wine quality. As the heatmap suggests, alcohol has the strongest correlation with wine quality.

##Wine Quality

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
#Distribution of red wine quality ratings
ggplot(redwine,aes(x=quality))+geom_bar(stat = "count",position = "dodge")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(3,8,1))+
  ggtitle("Distribution of Red Wine Quality Ratings")+
  theme_classic()
```

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
#Distribution of good/bad red wines
ggplot(redwine,aes(x=quality_wine,fill=factor(quality_wine)))+geom_bar(stat = "count",position = "dodge")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,1,1))+
  ggtitle("Distribution of Good/Bad Red Wines")+
  theme_classic()
```

Above plot shows what we have inferred previously, that good wines were outnumbered by bad wines by a large margin. Most wines were mediocre (rated 5 or 6), but we could also see that there are some poor wines (3 or 4). A vast majority of good wines has a quality rating of 7.

##Predictive Modelling (Binary Classification)

As indicated in the synopsis, we would utilize a random forest as our baseline model in predicting the quality of a wine. We will not be using any hyper-parameter tuning and stick with the default of the randomForest function

```{r}
#Baseline Random Forest Model
redwineRF<-randomForest(factor(quality_wine)~.-quality,redwine,ntree=150)
redwineRF
```

The overall accuracy of our model is pretty good at around 92% overall. However, we could clearly see that it is much better in predicting bad wines than good ones.

###Variable Importance

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
# Get importance
importance    <- randomForest::importance(redwineRF)

varImportance <- data.frame(Variables = row.names(importance), 
                            Importance = round(importance[ ,'MeanDecreaseGini'],2))

# Create a rank variable based on importance
rankImportance <- varImportance %>%
  mutate(Rank = paste0('#',dense_rank(desc(Importance))))

# Use ggplot2 to visualize the relative importance of variables
ggplot(rankImportance, aes(x = reorder(Variables, Importance), 
                           y = Importance, fill = Importance)) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity') + 
  geom_text(aes(x = Variables, y = 0.5, label = Rank),
            hjust=0, vjust=0.55, size = 4, colour = 'red') +
  labs(x = 'Variables') +
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_classic()
```

###Hyperparameter tuning
```{r}
# hyperparameter grid search
hyper_grid <- expand.grid(
  mtry       = seq(1, 10, by = 2),
  node_size  = seq(3, 9, by = 2),
  sampe_size = c(.55, .632, .70, .80),
  acc   = 0
)
