## 2 Tidy data and iteration

# 2.1 Missing data and iteration
```{r}
impute_by_median <- function(x){
  med<-median(x,na.rm=1) 
  impute_f <- function(y){
    if(is.na(y)){
      return(med)
    }else{
      return(y)
    }
  }
  return(map_dbl(x,impute_f))
}
v<-c(1,2,NA,4)
impute_by_median(v)
```

Next generate a data frame with two variables x and y. For our first variable x we have a sequence
(x1, x2, . . . , xn) where x1 = 0, xn = 10 and for each i = 1, . . . , n − 1, xi+1 = xi + 0.1. For our second
variable y we set yi = 5 × xi + 1 for i = 1, . . . , n. Generate data of this form and place within a data frame
called df_xy.

```{r}
x <- seq(0,10,0.1)
y<-5*x+1
df_xy <- data.frame(x,y)
df_xy %>% head(5)
```

The map2() function is similar to the map() function but iterates over two variables in parallel rather
than one. You can learn more here https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map2.html. The following simple
example shows you how map2_dbl() can be combined with the mutate() function.

```{r}
df_xy%>%
mutate(z=map2_dbl(x,y,~.x+.y))%>%
head(5)
```

First create a function sometimes_missing with two variables index and value. The function should return
NA if index is divisible by 5 and returns value otherwise.

```{r}
sometimes_missing <- function(index,value){
  if (index%%5 == 0){
    return(NA)
    }
  else{
    return(value)
    }
}
sometimes_missing(14,25)
sometimes_missing(15,25)
```

Next generate a new data frame called df_xy_missing with two variables x and y, but some missing data.
For the first variable x we have a sequence (x1, · · · , xn), which is precisely the same as with df_xy. For
the second variable y we have a sequence (˜y1, · · · , y˜n) where y˜i = NA if i is divisible by 5 and y˜i = yi for
i not divisible by 5. To generate the dataframe d_xy_missing you may want to make use of the functions
row_number(), map2_dbl(), mutate() as well as sometimes_missing().
